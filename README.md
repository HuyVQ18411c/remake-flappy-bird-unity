# Flappy Bird Remake
## C# and Game Development using Unity.

After a few days of research, Unity definitely a good choice for a beginner/curious person like me besides Pygame which using Python. Although Python in general is a great language to learn new things quickly, C-Sharp always give me a great sense of the project structure, and the pattern which I should follow along the way.
# Some important concepts that I have learned:
- Collision: how game object will interact with each other in this virtual enviroment.  
- Trigger collision.
- FPS: FPS will have a huge impact to user experience if we don't optimize and put things in right places. 
- Game object: anything in C# is object, anything in Unity can be seen as an Game Object.
- Sprite (in Unity).
- Scripts: which should be so familiar to anyone has some knowledge about WPF or Windows Form
- Scene: each scene contains many game objects, and can be divided for many using contexts such as menu (scene), level(s) (scene), game over (scene).
